I am drawing a solar system made up of :)

Primitives: GL_LINE_STRIP, GL_TRIANGLE_FAN, GL_POINTS.

Transformations: glTranslatef, glRotatef, glScalef.

I have modified display(), init() to change the background color to black, and also added a few of my own functions all found above display().

Coolest thing: The building block of the Universe is :)

Any other things: 
1) The distance between the orbit rings are correct in terms of ratio. 
2) The size of the planets are all correct in terms of ratio to one another.
3) Random stars are generated when you run the program. You can move the stars around with the keyboard.
